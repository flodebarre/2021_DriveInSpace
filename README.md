This repository contains the codes to run and plot the stochastic simulations presented in our article. 

# Contents

-  `stochwave_migale.c` is the main C code of the simulation;  
-  `runStochWave_Migale_2.sh` is a code to run the code on a cluster;
-  `data/` contains the output of the simulations (the files were imported back from the cluster); 
-  `R/` contains the code to plot the outcome, and a subfolder `Pics/` where the figure(s) are saved.
